## üöÄ Training the Model

Train your YOLOv8 model on your bird dataset using the following command:
```bash
yolo detect train \
  data=data.yaml \
  model=yolov8n.pt \
  epochs=10 \
  imgsz=640 \
  name=bird-detector
```
- `data`: Path to your dataset configuration file.
- `model`: Pretrained YOLOv8 model to start from.
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `imgsz`: Input image size.
- `name`: Name for your training run.
